## Assignment Writeup

### Part 1 (45 pts)


1. v0idcache’s real name is Elizabeth Moffet. I found this by just googling the username and stumbling upon her twitter.

2. She is the Banking CEO at the website http://1337bank.money/ which is in her Twitter bio.

3. Elizabeth has a Twitter which I found by googling v0idcache.

4. I found 142.93.136.81 by going to https://securitytrails.com/dns-trails and looking up the URL of the website.
The location of the server is in the Netherlands in Amsterdam which I found through putting the website’s IP address in Censys.io.

5. By using http://1337bank.money/robots.txt I found a secret directory: http://1337bank.money/secret_directory. This led me to the flag: CMSC389R-{h1ding_fil3s_in_r0bots_L0L}


6. What ports are open on the website? What services are running behind these ports? How did you discover this?
I found what ports were open by using the nmap command on the website. This initially only return ports 80 and 22 which were open. Therefore I had to expand the range to find more open ports which led me to port 1337 which was open and the right port I needed to access for part 2.
7. Which operating system is running on the website? How did you discover this?
8. BONUS: Did you find any other flags on your OSINT mission? (Up to 9 pts!)
I found CMSC389R-{h1dd3n_1n_plain_5ight} which was found through the HTML code on her website in a comment.
I also found CMSC389R-{h0w_2_iNt0_DNS_r3c0Rd5} which was found through the DNS records generated by https://centralops.net/co/DomainDossier.aspx




### Part 2 (75 pts)

I updated the python script to read passwords from rockyou.txt and try them on the port 1337 on the website. Since it was really slow I added multithreading to speed up the process. Every time a password is entered and it is incorrect, the server sends back “Fail\n.” So I checked when the returned data was not “Fail\n” -which meant it succeeded- and then stored the password. I stored the result in a global variable which then stops a while loop that keeps calling the brute_force function with different passwords. After, the correct password is printed out to the console which let me know that the password was “linkinpark.” Then I used the command “nc 1337bank.money 1337” and entered the username “v0idcache” and the password “linkinpark.” This printed “Success” and I was in the file system. I switched to the /home directory where I found the flag CMSC389R-{brut3_f0rce_m4ster} in a file called flag.txt. I initially did it with a single thread but never found it in time. Since I did not know how long it would take, I added multple threads to increase the speed dramatically.

### Part 2 (75 pts)

<p>On the company’s side of the issue, there is a lot to lose by addressing the security problems. It is vital to tell the boss first because he/she has the power to address the issue. The boss may disregard the problem due to the financial impact on the company. The company’s production will stagnate trying to fix the issues, and if the company falls apart, everyone will lose their job including myself. If the boss refuses, the right steps would be to consider the “legality” surrounding the issues as mentioned in the slides from lecture 1. For example, if the produced engines have a life-threatening flaw then it is imperative to convey this to the boss, as consumers may even sue the company.<\p><br />
<p>If nothing is done about the issue, it is partially my fault if any harm results. Whistleblowers are individuals that expose the wrongdoings of a company from the inside. Given that I know the flaws in the firmware, I could be a whistleblower and have exposed the company to the public if it did not address the issue. However, this will most likely cost my job. On the other hand, it is also the boss’s fault for not addressing the issue because he/she is the one that has the final decision in fixing the issues. In reality, people care about their jobs to survive as open jobs are decreasing every year. They would obey their boss to preserve their jobs and not resort to something such as whistleblowing to protect others.<\p><br />
<\p>Personally, I believe the company should fix the issue immediately. This is because the company will lose reputation, money from suing, and face legal issues which would all cause the company to fall. The company may lose some money and time trying to fix the issue, but the aforementioned consequences are not worth the risks of not addressing the issues.<\p>
